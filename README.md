# SQL_Exercise_3
Bootcamp Class Exercise 2

## **Instructions from Class Assignment Notes**

* Add data into a database called FavoriteDB. Data should be unique and you should try to test your skills in adding new data, and updating existing data!

* Add at least three rows of data to each table.

## **Bonus**

* Create a column that has a default value within it, and note how default values work when creating new rows.

* Create a column with a default value that automatically goes up with each new row

* Asssign a column the "primary key"

* Create a column called "id" in one of your tables that can contain an integer, is the primary key for the table, cannot be NULL, and automatically increments with each new row added.
